## ðŸ‘‹ Alii, my name is Zue. 
I am Software Engineer from Palau, and *Alii is 'hello'* in Palauan. 

### ðŸŒ± I'm on my Dev Journey!  
Iâ€™m currently learning: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, Database Theory, Bookshelf.js, MongoDB, MySQL, Command Line, Git, and Java. 

### ðŸ™Œ Outside of that, 
I read books on my Kindle, <br> 
and constantly update my Notion. <br> 
I go on long walks daily, curate my Spotify playlists, and think about my dream life. <br> 
I also have my PADI license and looking for a dive buddy!
